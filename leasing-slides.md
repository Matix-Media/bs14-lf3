# Leasing vs. Buying: IT Workstations
Analysis for GEEK-Fitness GmbH Purchasing Department

---

## Context: Task 5 Requirement
*   Evaluate the economic viability of leasing versus purchasing new client systems.
*   Focus: New workstations for the Purchasing department (Einkauf).
*   Goal: Provide a recommendation based on cost, flexibility, and technology lifecycle.

## What is IT Equipment Leasing?
(Based on Section 2.7.1)

*   **Renting hardware** (like PCs) instead of buying it outright.
*   Involves a **contract** with a provider for a **fixed period**.
*   Requires **regular payments** (usually monthly).
*   **Ownership** typically remains with the leasing company.
*   Equipment is usually **returned or refreshed** at the end of the lease term.

---

## Advantages of Leasing
(Based on Section 2.7.2)

*   **Lower Upfront Cost:** Avoids large initial capital expenditure.
*   **Predictable Budgeting:** Fixed, regular payments are easier to budget.
*   **Technology Refresh:** Easier to upgrade to newer hardware at the end of the lease term, avoiding obsolescence.
*   **Maintenance/Support:** Often included in the lease agreement, reducing unexpected repair costs.
*   **Flexibility:** Easier to scale equipment needs up or down at renewal periods.
*   **Disposal:** Leasing company handles end-of-life equipment disposal.
*   **Tax Benefits:** Lease payments are often fully tax-deductible as operating expenses (Verify with Finance Dept.).

## Disadvantages of Leasing
(Based on Section 2.7.2)

*   **No Ownership:** The company never owns the equipment; it's not an asset on the balance sheet.
*   **Higher Total Cost (Potentially):** Over the *entire* duration of multiple lease cycles, the total payments might exceed the cost of buying and using equipment for a longer period.
*   **Contractual Obligation:** Locked into payments for the full lease term.
*   **Potential Fees:** Charges may apply for excessive wear/tear or early termination.

## Cost Comparison: Assumptions
(Based on Section 2.7.3)

*   **Scenario:** 5 new PC workstations for Purchasing Dept.
*   **Purchase Estimate:** €1,200 per PC (incl. software/3yr warranty) OR using client's €10,000 total estimate.
*   **Post-Warranty Maintenance (Buy):** Estimated at €100/PC/year (from year 4 onwards).
*   **Example Lease Cost:** €40 per PC per month (assumed to include full support).
*   **Comparison Periods:** 3 years and 5 years.

***Note:** These are example figures. Actual costs require specific quotes.*

## Cost Comparison: Purchase Scenario
(Based on Section 2.7.3 Example)

*   **Initial Outlay (Year 1):** **€10,000** (Using department estimate)
*   **Total Cost (3 Years):** **~€10,000** (+ potential repair costs outside warranty)
*   **Total Cost (5 Years):** €10,000 + (2 years * 5 PCs * €100/PC/yr) = **~€11,000** (+ potential repair costs)

*   *Key Point:* High upfront cost, company owns assets, responsible for long-term maintenance/disposal.

---

## Cost Comparison: Leasing Scenario
(Based on Section 2.7.3 Example)

*   **Monthly Cost:** 5 PCs * €40/month = €200
*   **Annual Cost:** €200 * 12 = €2,400
*   **Total Cost (3 Years):** €2,400 * 3 = **€7,200** (Includes support)
*   **Total Cost (5 Years):** €2,400 * 5 = **€12,000** (Includes support & likely tech refresh opportunity after year 3)

*   *Key Point:* Low upfront cost, predictable payments, support included, easy tech refresh.

## Cost Comparison: Assessment
(Based on Section 2.7.3)

*   **Short-Term (3 Years):** Leasing (€7,200) is significantly cheaper than the estimated purchase cost (€10,000+).
*   **Longer-Term (5 Years):** Costs become more comparable (€12,000 leasing vs. €11,000+ buying), *but* leasing typically includes ongoing support and the option for a hardware refresh after the initial term.
*   **Budget Impact:** Leasing avoids a large initial capital hit.
*   **Operational Impact:** Included support with leasing simplifies maintenance.

---

## Recommendation
(Based on Section 2.7.3)

*   For predictable costs, included support/maintenance, and simplified technology upgrades (aligning with typical 3-4 year refresh cycles), **Leasing** is recommended for the new Purchasing department workstations.
*   **Final Decision:** Should be made after obtaining actual quotes from leasing providers and consulting with the GEEK-Fitness GmbH finance department regarding tax implications and budget preferences.
